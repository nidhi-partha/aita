        <h3><i>What is AI?</i></h3>

        <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is…</h3>
        <p>
            Well, broadly, it’s the field that deals with the creation of machines that “think” intelligently or in the same way humans do! If you weren’t aware already, AI is all around you. Digital assistants (like Siri or Alexa), recommendation systems on Netflix and YouTube, spam filters in your inbox, autocomplete when you’re texting, and autonomous vehicles are all examples of AI you may be familiar with.

        <h3>AI vs. Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            “So can anything that acts intelligently be AI?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes. That Scratch chatbot you made in the third grade is, in fact, AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            But everything you hear about in the news seems to be a little more complicated than a few conditional statements… Well, what AI today more accurately refers to is machine learning, which we will abbreviate ML. ML are computer systems that can work intelligently without explicit instructions or programming to do so. It’s a subset of AI, but nowadays, most AI research is focused on ML.

        <h3>…AI vs. Humanity</h3>
        <p>
            As an avid sci-fi fan, I get it. These ultra advanced ML models start taking our jobs, then there’s a full-fledged robot war, and when they win, we’ve been banished to live underground forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, honestly, with the state of AI right now, this is a bit far-fetched. (Don’t believe us? See it for yourself.)
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID">Watch: Boston Dynamic's Atlas robot fail compilation</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Ok actually, whatever Boston Dynamics is doing seems really cool, but the point is that AI is still in its infancy. Currently, we (researchers, engineers, critics, learners, etc.) shape AI, and we hold the power to influence AI in its most formative state. If we don’t want to get banished underground, the worst thing we can do is turn away from AI and let a select few control its direction. We must instead engage with it, molding AI into something that can eventually benefit all of us.

        <h3>Cool, Tell me More</h3>
        <p>
            We’ll start with <b>computer vision</b>, which deals with, as its name suggests, a computer’s ability to see. For example identifying different chest diseases.
        </p>
        <p>__</p>
        <p>
            The basic idea behind this algorithm is that if we gave it a ton of information of chest xrays and the disease it was associated with, labeled data in other words, it could eventually figure it out for itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            And more broadly, computer vision models have been useful tools for detecting pathology in X-Rays, CT scans, and MRIs.
        </p>
        <p>Another important application of computer vision includes pedestrian or street sign detection in autonomous vehicles. Equipped with cameras, these vehicles take pictures of their surroundings many times per second. To know when to slow down, stop, or speed up, computer vision systems must assess these images quickly.

            One way researchers build datasets of labeled data is through crowdsourcing. For instance, Google creates a dataset of labeled doodles through their <a href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/">Quick Draw</a> game. Go ahead, play a round or two (or three or four.) Oftentimes, people don’t know they’re contributing to a dataset that eventually trains an algorithm to recognize objects in drawings. Read more on <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset">GitHub</a> and scroll down to the “Projects using the dataset” section to see how people have used this data in their own projects.
            </p>
        <p>__</p>
            <p>Cool! Next up on our list is <b>natural language processing</b> or NLP. Perhaps you’ve heard of <a href="chat.openai.com">Chat-GPT</a>, but NLP is also found in inbox spam-filters, autocomplete, and voice to text services. Essentially how large language models learn is from internet crawl data, which are massive (multiple petabytes, 1PB = 1000TB =  10000000000GB) datasets of just about everything on the internet. Eventually, the patterns they discern in the data allow them to mimic human speech behaviors like idioms and grammar. 
            </p>
            <p>Where language models like GPT trip up is the validity of what they say. In some ways, they can generate factually accurate statements, but at the same time, they are susceptible to the vast amounts of false information in common crawl data. An oversimplified version of GPT works is that it generates new text based on what came before it probabilistically. In this way, ChatGPT is really good at responding to human queries in a believable way. What it sucks at is verifying if any of the text that is likely to follow previous text is true. See below how a similar prompt generates two responses with differing information. 
            </p>
            <p>Language models like GPT belong to the broader class of generative AI. It’s used medically in genome mapping and emerging CRISPR technologies. But you may be familiar with generative AI’s overlap with computer vision. Below is Unsupervised, a collection of AI-generated artwork in the MoMA by Refik Anadol. 
            </p>

        <h3><i>What has AI Looked Like? What Will it Look Like in the Future?
        </i></h3>

        <h3>A Brief History </h3>
        <p>
            According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Artificial intelligence is defined as “The capacity of computers or other machines to exhibit or simulate intelligent behavior; the field of study concerned with this.” So yes, AI is an enormously broad term, encompassing everything from GPT to simple if statements. At the same time, the AI “hype” in the media has more to do with the former example than the latter. And I guess this is because most of the research (and hype) nowadays is in neural networks, which as their names suggest, model biological processes.
        </p>
        <p>Neural networks are not new; one of the first instances of these neural networks was in 1943 when Warren McCullough (a neurobiologist) and Walter Pitts (a logician) teamed up to create a mathematical model of a biological neuron [3] If you’ve taken biology, you probably know that human neurons fire due to some stimulus on its receiving end, which carries all the way down its axon and fires the next neuron. Similarly, the mathematical model McCullough and Pitts developed took in numerically valued inputs, fed them into a linear expression, and the value of which is finally used to decide whether or not that neuron is fired. When these artificial neurons, or equivalently perceptrons, are strung together in networks (as they are biologically), they can essentially model any mathematical function! 
        </p>

        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1390/1*SgJPlfKHwL-qis-aL19Fyg.png" alt="AI, ML, DL Image" class="center-image">

        <p>With these technological advancements in the 20th century, scientists became very interested in how and to what extent computers could carry out human thought processes. For instance, the Turing test, devised by Alan Turing (commonly regarded as the father of computing) in 1950, assesses whether a machine can think like a human. The Turing test has taken on technological significance as well as societal/philosophical significance, which shows the enduring legacy and foresight of this mid-century scientist [2] As an extension, you may want to read up on [2] [4][8] if you’re interested in machine consciousness. How do the two sources converse with each other? Would it be absurd to claim that a machine can become conscious? How may ideas of “humanness” and consciousness be conflated? Rightfully so?
        </p>
        <p>Then, there came two main AI winters that slowed down AI research [1]. A large contributor to this winter was the inadequate computing resources (computers were slow, so AI was not only computationally expensive but also financially) [5] Another contributor was Marvin Minsky’s book entitled Perceptrons that showed the inability of a single-layered neural network to do basic operations like the logical operator XOR [3] Minsky’s book also touched on the idea that with multiple layers, the above issue would be remedied, but nobody seemed to care :( [3] Combined, these factors led to intermittent stops in research and innovation, coining the AI winters.
        </p>
        
        <img src="https://media.tenor.com/yCGu_MdXYOgAAAAC/lilo-and-stitch-stitch.gif" alt="AI, ML, DL Image" class="center-image">

        <p>But in the nineties, improved computing resources prompted AI research to start up again! In 1995, Richard Wallace developed A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) which is a chatbot that used patterns in natural language to inform how it held conversations with humans [7] Another example is Kismet produced by MIT in 1998, a horrifying thing that could recognize and mimic human facial expressions [7]
        </p>
        <p>The innovation or moment that was perhaps most influential to the course of AI in the nineties, however, so was IBM’s Deep Blue [7]. Essentially, it’s essentially a supercomputer that learned to play chess. Computing over 200 million possibilities per second, it beat Garry Kasparov multiple times in 1996 who was world chess champion at the time. This victory for AI set the stage for more funding, research, and overall hope for the field of AI. As an extension, you may find it interesting that chess engines and AI have always been associated with each other. Even recently, games like chess and go have been topics of interest for AI labs like DeepMind. See this (really cool, 4min) video if you’re interested [9] There is also a 90 minute documentary if you are so inclined to watch [10]. 
        </p>
        <p>Since then, AI has exploded to include an enormous set of applications. You’re probably familiar with them if you read our previous chapter, so we won’t repeat them here. 
        </p>
        <h3>But it’s Certainly not all Sunshine and Rainbows
        </h3>
        <p>
            But even so, not all “breakthroughs'' in machine learning, or even in applications of data science for that matter, incite positive societal change. For example, we will look at the COMPAS courtroom assessment, which seeks to determine defendents’ likelihood of recidivism, or how likely they are to reoffend. 
        </p>

        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1160/0*cfX-3V_kHwT5o3_T" alt="AI, ML, DL Image" width="550" height="300" class="center-image">

        <p>
            Here, the algorithm was biased toward white defendants and against Black defendants. Originally created to prevent courtroom bias, the survey asked a myriad of “objective” questions about family status, childhood experiences, and emotional/physical tendencies. However, what it didn’t take into account was that certain questions were proxies to race. For instance, one of the questions asked about getting detention in school. Black students are more likely to get put into detention compared to their white peers for similar offenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally, algorithmic biases perpetuate many of our society’s inequalities and injustices. This is essentially because model do what model see. If the data is unrepresentative, flawed, or in some way reflective of a bias, the model will find those erroneous patterns and make incorrect or biased predictions. 
        </p>
        <p>Another example of this is an experimental AI algorithm used by Amazon to recruit employees. Conditioned on years worth of data that showed preference for men over women, the algorithm demonstrated bias against women—even going as far to produce measurable “penalties” for applicants who attended womens’ colleges. Luckily, this algorithm did not appear to be used in real recruiting practices, but had there not been this experiment, would this sexism be as visible?
        </p>
        <p>Now this isn’t to say that all bias is inherently bad—in fact, all humans have certain biases. For example if you type everything in one font, a different font may be confusing or unnatural. However, this can become dangerous when these biases don’t acknowledge exceptions or are biased against certain groups of people. This is shown in the examples above, for women or colored people. This is discrimination.
