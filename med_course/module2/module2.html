        <h3>What is a Notebook?</h3>


        <p>
            You may be thinking you already know what a notebook is, but notebooks in programming are a little different. Notebooks provide an interactive environment where developers can write and execute code in small, manageable chunks called cells. This interactivity is crucial for experimenting with different algorithms, models, and data preprocessing steps in real time. It allows developers to iterate quickly and efficiently, which is essential in the iterative process of AI model development. 
        </p>

        <p>--------</p>
        <p>Some common notebooks are Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, and Kaggle. 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Colab is great for quick, cloud-based experimentation with free GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) access. 
            </li>
            <li>Jupyter Notebook offers more flexibility as it can be run locally on your own machine but requires more setup. 
            </li>
            <li>Kaggle Kernels are excellent for Kaggle competitions and datasets, with a strong community and collaboration features.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <p>For the purposes of this course, we will be using Colab as it is beginner friendly and has free GPU access.
        </p>  
        <h3>Getting Set Up</h3>
        <p>
            Here is an article where you can learn how to set up Colab as well as some good tips:

        </p>

        <p>Watch the video below for a tutorial on how to use colab for beginners.</p>

        <p>Here are some command short cuts you might want to know!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Command Pallete – Ctrl+Shift+P
            </li>
            <li>Add a comment – Ctrl+Alt+M
            </li>
            <li>Convert to text cell – Ctrl+M M
            </li>
            <li>Add a new cell below – Ctrl+B B
            </li>
            <li>Run all cells – Ctrl+F9
            </li>
            <li>Run the current cell – Ctrl+Enter
            </li>
            <li>Save Notebook – Ctrl+S
            </li>
            <li>Show keyboard shortcuts – Ctrl+M H
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>What is a Runtime?</h3>
        <p>
            The runtime in Google Colaboratory is the virtual machine that executes your notebooks code. You can choose between CPU and GPU runtimes, allocate resources, manage dependencies, and make use of the cloud-based environment for various data science and machine learning tasks. Understanding how to work with the Colab runtime is essential for utilizing its resources effectively. To learn more about GPUs and TPUs read <a href="https://mygraphicscard.com/tpu-vs-gpu/"> this article</a>. To use GPU you need to go to runtime on the top of your notebook and change the hardware accelerator to GPU.

            Python is…
        </h3>
        <p>
            Python is a programming language that is known for its readability and ease of use among other things. Because of this, Python serves as a lot of people’s first language! But just because Python is very beginner friendly doesn’t mean it isn’t powerful. In fact, as you’ll see in the examples below, its ease of implementation allows us to do complicated things with less code and in a readable way. In the world of AI, a lot of work is done with Python.
        </p>
        <p>This module is a brief overview of basic python. Please go over these videos for more information on the topics below. There will also be more videos linked throughout this section for better understanding. It is integral that these concepts are known before we move on to learning about AI.
